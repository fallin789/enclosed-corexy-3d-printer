I finished the psu mount that will mount onto the v-slot of the exturtion this took about a hour. then I moved onto making the frame in CAD using 4 double extrutions for the z axis these are 400mm long. the x axis exturtions will be 3 singles that are 370mm. The y axis will be 4 single exturtions that are 410mm long. the x and y have a 40mm differance this is because it will make a perfect square when i connect them. also i only use 3 on the x because the front top will be open for cost and if someone didn't wan't to make it enclosed it is a lot easier to take out the bed with a part on it. overall I worked 4 hours on it today.
